    <h1>ALT SCHOOL Assignment (1)</h1>
    <h2> ALT School ID : ALT/SOE/025/3907</h2>
    <section>
        <p> My name is Omaku Andrew, and I come from Kogi State in Nigeria, a place known for its mix of cultures and history. Right now, I’m studying Computer Science at Landmark University. 
            I love learning how to turn ideas into programs that solve real problems. Over the years, I’ve picked up different coding languages and frameworks, always hunting for new ways to build useful tools. 
            Outside of classes, I join hackathons, contribute to open‑source projects, and team up on side projects so I can put what I learn into action.
        </p>

        <p>My hobbies include reading, coding, and majorly steering at screens learning other cool stuffs like I am doing now in ALT School.
            I also enjoy playing video games and relates with friends with similar interests in tech and growth in general.
        </p>

        <p>
           My decision to join ALT School was driven by a clear recognition: to excel as a data engineer, one must first master the bedrock of software engineering and development. 
           I sought out an environment that not only offered comprehensive, hands‑on technical training, but also a vibrant community of learners, mentors, and practitioners. ALT School’s project‑based curriculum and peer‑driven support structure promised exactly that. 
           Motivated by a desire to level up my understanding of core development workflows—version control, continuous integration and deployment, scalable system design—I enrolled wholeheartedly, ready to absorb every lesson, tackle every coding challenge, and contribute to group projects.
            I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on real‑world projects, collaborate with fellow students, and learn from experienced instructors.
            I believe that this hands‑on approach will not only deepen my understanding of software engineering principles but also equip me with the practical skills needed to thrive in the tech industry.
        </p>

        <p>
            While I appreciate the depth and thoroughness of the curriculum, I can’t deny that the pace feels slower than I initially hoped. There are moments when I wish we could move faster—tackle more advanced topics or dive into complex projects sooner. At the same time, I recognize that this slower pace gives me the breathing room to really absorb each concept, ask thoughtful questions, and build solid foundations rather than just racing ahead.
            I’m optimistic because I know I won’t be going through this alone: I’ll be surrounded by classmates who share my drive and curiosity, and many of them bring their own real‑world experience to our discussions. On top of that, ALT School brings in guest facilitators and technology experts to lead special seminars throughout the semester. These sessions—whether it’s a deep dive into cloud data architectures, a workshop on best practices for testing and deployment, or a Q&A with a seasoned data engineer—will inject fresh energy into our learning and help me connect directly with people who’ve already walked the path I’m on. All together, this supportive network of peers and pros gives me confidence that even at a measured pace, I’ll extract every insight I need and build relationships that will propel my career forward.
        </p>

        <p>
            In conclusion, I’m excited to be part of ALT School’s Engineering program. I’m ready to work hard on every assignment, whether I’m coding by myself or teaming up with classmates on big projects. I also want to give back by sharing tips or leading a mini‑workshop when I learn something new. Together with my peers, I look forward to growing my skills, building cool things, and making a positive impact in tech.
        </p>
